# AI Research Notes

This repository contains my independent study and research notes on artificial intelligence.

## Focus
- Understanding AI concepts from first principles
- Comparing approaches and assumptions
- Exploring societal and African-context implications

## Philosophy
I do not treat AI as magic. Every system is a set of trade-offs.
