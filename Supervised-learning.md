## Definition
Supervised learning involves learning a mapping from inputs to labeled outputs.

## Why It Matters
It underpins most real-world AI systems in use today.

## Strengths
- Predictable behavior
- Easier evaluation

## Weaknesses
- Requires labeled data
- Can encode bias

## My Insight
Most failures in supervised learning are data problems, not model problems.
