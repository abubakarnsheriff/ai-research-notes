## Types of Artificial Intelligence

AI systems are commonly categorized based on their capabilities and scope.

## Main Categories

### Narrow AI
Designed to perform a specific task (e.g., image recognition, recommendation systems).

### General AI
A hypothetical form of AI capable of understanding and learning any intellectual task a human can do.

### Superintelligent AI
An advanced theoretical concept where AI surpasses human intelligence across all domains.

## Why it matters
Understanding these categories prevents confusion between what exists today and what is still theoretical.

## My Insight
Public fear of AI often comes from confusing narrow AI with speculative general or superintelligent AI.

## Reality Check
All AI systems in practical use today are Narrow AI. General and Superintelligent AI remain theoretical and speculative.
