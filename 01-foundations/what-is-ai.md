## What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is the use of algorithms and data to optimize decisions or predictions toward a defined objective under constraints.


## Why it matters
AI shifts decision-making from human intuition to data-driven systems, changing power, accountability, and scale across industries and societies.


## My Insight
AI systems do not understand problems; they exploit patterns. When patterns change, AI fails silently unless humans notice.
